- > Basic playback controls (play/pause if implemented).

## Technologies Used

- >HTML5 (for page structure)
- >CSS3 (for styling)
- >JavaScript (for any interactive elements or playback controls, if included)

## Known Limitations

- > This project is a frontend-focused clone. It does not include song streaming functionality or dynamic song changes.

## Future Development

- > Implement dynamic song loading and changing.
- > Add more advanced playback controls (seek bar, shuffle, etc.).
- > Explore integration with a music API (this would be a significant backend addition).

## Lessons Learned

* **The Power of CSS Styling:** I discovered how intricate CSS can be for replicating complex user interfaces like Spotify's.  I learned better techniques for layout, responsiveness, and creating visual effects.
* **JavaScript for Interactivity (if applicable):**  Implementing features like play/pause buttons highlighted the importance of understanding event listeners and DOM manipulation within JavaScript. 
* **Challenges of Music Functionality:** I originally intended to add dynamic song switching, but this underscored the complexity of integrating with music APIs and the need for backend development.
* **Value of Iteration:** This project reinforced the importance of starting with a basic structure, then gradually adding and refining features.
